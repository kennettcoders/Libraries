        <h3>Welcome to the Kennett Coders' GitHub Page</h3>

<p>If you click on the "View on GitHub" Button, you will be able to see all the code that we have written this year, and in years past. The goal of our GitHub is to allow other members of our team, and for other people, to use code that has been written to solve problems. We have two branches on our GitHub; the [master] branch and the [gh-pages] branch(which you are viewing right now). If in the future, we have more branches, we will update this page with the information on those branches.</p>

<hr><h3>[master] branch</h3>

<p>This is where all our files and code is located. It is organized by competition year, and then team number and name.</p>

<hr><h3>[gh-pages] branch</h3>

<p>This is the website face. any file in here will be rendered for web viewing, like this page.</p>
