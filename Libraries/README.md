Libraries
=========

This folder contains code snippets that solve issues with aspects of the robot, controller, or other issues. An example is code written for a VEX PIX Controller, that provides the controller with a limiter on the joysticks, so any value under ten is ignored and elvaluates to zero.

(the example above will be uploaded as soon as the code is ready to be commited)
